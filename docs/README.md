# Documentation

This contains all the needed documentation to (hopefully) help you explicate and
understand what Nix is, how to use it wisely, how to play with PostgreSQL, and
probably other stuff to help educate you.

## Table of Contents

- **[00 &mdash; Starting Line](./00-START-HERE.md)** &mdash; we'll install Nix
  and play around with it a little.
- **[01 &mdash; Use this Repository](./01-USE-THIS-REPO.md)** &mdash; We'll
  build a PostreSQL distribution, and also use the magical `nix develop`
